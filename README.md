# MP1_InfiniteMatrix
This repository is my MP1: Infinite Matrix project for CS 415: Game Development. To run, clone the repository and open the project in Unreal Engine 5.

This game is a first person endless runner, where the player is flying down a tunnel and must go through the holes in the walls to survive. Additionally, there are kraken enemies that the player must either avoid or shoot at, and to regain health, the player can grab healthpacks that look like the very tunnel the player is in.
